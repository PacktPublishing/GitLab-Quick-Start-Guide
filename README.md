## Get to Know the Author
**Adam O'Grady**
hails from the remote Perth, Western Australia, and can usually be found on Twitter at @adamjogrady or in meatspace wrangling with code.

His first taste of programming came from building games into graphics calculators at high school, and quickly developed into a passion. A few years later, while doing social media marketing for an ISP, his first big break arrived; building custom applications to monitor and respond to social feeds.

After that, he spent a few years working for the government building systems that used satellite and geographic data to spot and predict bushfires, and now you can find him leading a small team of engineering mavens at a local health start-up.
